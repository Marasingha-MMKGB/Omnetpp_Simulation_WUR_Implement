This here is a simplest WuR configuration of iot network as a power conservation method

Implemented function:

1.Basic Wur Functions : main ratio active upon receving a WuS from WUrX
2.if there any msg do neo properly transfer there will be no ACK send to node B
3.if ACK will not recive the process will be desyncronized 

this is the currunt Wur development according to light weight protocol for wur enabled sensor networks
